## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I gained practical experience implementing dynamic theme toggle functionality, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes.

I also gained practical experience with data filtering techniques using native JavaScript to dynamically update the displayed content based on specific criteria.

Finally, I improved my ability to integrate and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive user experiences.
